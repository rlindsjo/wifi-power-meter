wifi-power-meter
================

Sense household power (blinking led) and transmit to server over WIFI.

This project will consist of several parts which together will measure the blinks generated by common household power 
meters and upload the measurements to a server. In my case the power meter emits 10000 blinks per KWh, so each measured
blink is 0.1 Wh. By storing the blink count every few seconds to few minutes it is possible to se the impact of using 
the oven, microwave, water heater etc.

The main parts are

* Client hardware
* Client software
* Server software

Each part will be described below.

Client Hardware
---------------

Initially an Arduino UNO (easy prototyping), a photo transistor (for detecting the blinks) and a WiFly (for communicating
with the server). 

The photo transistor will generate an interrupt.

Client Software
---------------

The client will wakeup periodically and send the blink counter value to the server using the WiFly module. Initially each
wakeup will initiate a data transfer, but later on many datapoints can be stored locally and uploaded later to save
bandwidth and allow for temporary connection issues.

Each interrupt will increase the blink counter.

Server Software
---------------

Software running in a "cloud" environment and will initiall just allow for the client to store the data and have an API
for fetching the stored data. Later will be increased to have a user interface for plotting the data.
